## Basic principles, math review
What is machine learning?  We’ll discuss the broad strokes of the subject in order to understand how to approach different problems: supervised and unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, linear and non-linear classifiers.  How do we transform real-world problems into the formalisms that permit us to apply machine learning and use computers to solve problems?
We’ll follow with a quick review of probability, statistics, and linear algebra.  Our focus is on intuition, so no worries if this was hard at university: we'll draw some pictures and get you painlessly up to speed!

## Linear regression
Model the relationship between real-valued variables.  Use the model to predict unknown values and to understand the strength of your prediction.  When it comes to modeling continuous variables, linear regression is often the first tool to use, and simple variations of it address a surprisingly large array of problems.

## Logistic regression
Logistic regression is a work horse of machine learning and with minor variations will take us all the way to neural networks and deep learning.  It is a probabilistic model for separating (distinguishing) categorical variables.  We build separators in order to predict or classify.  Examples include predicting disease, elections, and engineering failures (exploding rockets, …).

## Support Vector Machines (SVM)
On the road from logistic regression to neural networks, an extraordinarily useful tool is the support vector machine, also known as a large margin classifier. Until very recently, SVM was the best known technique for many tasks, among them handwriting recognition (which we will revisit during Special Topics Day on Thursday).  We’ll finish our day Monday be looking at how this algorithm works and what we can do with it.
