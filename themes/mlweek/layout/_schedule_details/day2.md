## SVM (from Monday)

### Clustering
Data rarely comes adequately labeled.  Clustering provides techniques for grouping data for further analysis.  Often we use clustering as an exploratory technique to help us form hypotheses about our data.  We’ll see cluster analysis again when we discuss anomaly detection on Wednesday.

## Neural networks
If brains can think, perhaps machines that look like brains can think.  With that reasoning, computer science researchers in the mid-20th century embarked on a program of research that resulted in a family of algorithms that we call artificial neural networks.  We’ll talk about what artificial neural networks are, what they can do, what they can’t do, and why they’ve recently become quite fashionable.
Of course, we’ll build some simple neural networks, train them, and use them to classify some data.
