Good machine learning practitioners define problems before tackling them.  This course is no exception.  Our goal is to review the main techniques available for learning from data using python-based tools.  Why python?  Because there are some good tools available and because, whether or not you already know python, we can help you learn enough to do the course and so learn the main material.
We’ll divide days into morning and afternoon, and each of those we’ll divide into before the snack break and after the snack break.  And in each of those sections, we’ll spend about half of our time talking about algorithms and computer science and the other half actually building machine learning models using python, scikit-learn, and a handful of other convenient and useful tools.
Our goals with these tools isn’t to make you an expert in their use -- we don’t have the time it takes for that.  Our goal is to get you going so that you can attack the problems you face in your professional life and start making rapid progress.  Understanding how to set up and approach a problem will help you get going no matter what language you use in your professional life.
