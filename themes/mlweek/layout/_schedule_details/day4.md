These are all topics that have advanced enormously in the past decade.  We’ll talk about how they used to look and how they look now, so if you find yourself talking to someone not current in the field, you’ll know how to respond.

## Image recognition
We’ll do a quick survey of some of the main techniques for image recognition, then we’ll build an image classifier.

## Handwriting recognition
We’ll talk about some of the principle means for identifying handwriting (and what the issues and trade-offs are), then we’ll build a tool to identify handwritten text.

## Understanding text
What can we say about text?  We’ll look at summarization, sentiment analysis, and a few other features based on how much time we have and what our interest level is.

## Detecting spam
Spam detection is one of the canonical examples of machine learning.  So we’ll have a look, then we’ll build a spam classifier.

## Recommender systems
Recommendation is more than just Amazon offering to sell you things.  It’s also the articles in your social media feeds and search results everywhere.  We’ll have a look at the major techniques for recommendation (including Amazon’s techniques).  And then we’ll build a recommender.
